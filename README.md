# Password-Generator
First I created the outline of the password generator so it can run with no errors.  
Then I added characters to the var password.  
Next I added a for statement.  
After that I created an small scrip to get element by id.  
//problems- it runs with no errors but in the password box it displays all of the characters given to generate password.  
Next I deleted unessasary code like the "var passwordText = document.  querySelector("#password")".   
Then I added the variable Characters and added it to my for statement.  
I also had to add value to the password variable to fix the issue I had earlier with the password display box.
I created a New alert box and all the prompts I need.
Had to remove some of the prompts to limit confusion.  
Deleted unnessasary code.  
Added two new functions.   
Working on functionality of Uppercase func.
Added new functions after I got the initial function to log on the console.
Decided to delete some functions to simplify generator and avoid bugs.  
All prompts now log on the console.
Added new generate buttons elements.
