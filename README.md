# Password-Generator
First I created the outline of the password generator so it can run with no errors.  
Then I added characters to the var password.  
Next I added a for statement.  
After that I created an small scrip to get element by id.  
//problems- it runs with no errors but in the password box it displays all of the characters given to generate password.  
Next I deleted unessasary code like the "var passwordText = document.  querySelector("#password")".   
Then I added the variable Characters and added is to my for statement.  
I also had to add value to the password variable to fix the issue i had earlier with the password display box.
